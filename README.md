Basic Windows Settings from CLI

changed main file to winset.py

basically a (possibly) easier way to navigate to some import places within win 11: should look like this in cli (cmd)

classic apps:
1. classic settings (control)
2. classic uninstall (appwiz.cpl)
3. system properties (sysdm.cpl)
4. device amanger (diskmgmt.msc)
5. classic network-connections (ncpa.cpl)
6. firewall advanced settings (wf.msc)
7. local group policy editor (pro/enterprise) (gpedit.msc)
8. task scheduler taskschd.msc
9. service manager (services.msc)
10. performance manager (perfmon)
11. windows memory diagnostic (mdsched.exe)
L. list again
Q. exit
:

enter numerical id and it should load the equivalent of the paranthesized command (such as using WIN+R)
